Iâ€™m interested in programming languages and machine learning.

Currently, I work on machine learning for code and software engineering at
Google Brain.

Previously, I worked (in the opposite direction) on programming languages for
machine learning - in particular on [Swift for TensorFlow][s4tf] and
[differentiable programming in Swift][swift-dp].

Some writings:
- [What types work with differentiation?][differentiable-types]
- [Automatic differentiation vs differentiable programming][autodiff-vs-dp]
- [Blog][blog] (many unpublished drafts, let me know if you want to read more)
